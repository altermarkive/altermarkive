/**
 * composables/useUniversalRecognition.ts
 *
 * Live transcription that runs entirely in the page: the microphone is captured
 * with `getUserMedia`, split into utterances by the energy VAD, and each
 * utterance is transcribed by Whisper through Transformers.js.
 *
 * This exists because the Web Speech path in `useRecognition.ts` needs a speech
 * service the browser may not be able to reach - plain Chromium ships without
 * the keys for it, and Firefox has no Web Speech API at all. Nothing here
 * leaves the device, so the only thing it needs is a microphone.
 *
 * What it costs: the model is downloaded on first use (cached afterwards), and
 * a line appears when its utterance ends rather than while it is being spoken,
 * so this path is later than Web Speech by roughly one pause plus one decode.
