/**
 * lib/vad.ts
 *
 * Energy-envelope Voice Activity Detection: it takes frames of audio, decides
 * which of them carry speech, and hands back one utterance at a time.
 *
 * A frame is a small fixed-size slice of samples - the unit the VAD looks at
 * one at a time rather than all at once. At 16 kHz, 20 ms is 320 samples, and
 * every call to `feed()` takes exactly that many. 20 ms is the usual choice in
 * speech processing because it matches the time scale of a phoneme: short
 * enough that speech/silence transitions are caught quickly, long enough that
 * the RMS energy is stable rather than fooled by individual waveform peaks. At
 * 10 ms the energy estimate gets noisy; at 40 ms fast transitions start to slip
 * through.
 *
 * Three things keep a plain energy test usable, all of them still inside the
 * energy envelope rather than reaching for a model: an adaptive noise floor, so
 * the threshold is relative to the room instead of absolute; hysteresis, so
 * opening a segment is harder than keeping one open; and pre-speech padding, so
 * a segment does not begin midway through its first word. Each is commented at
 * the point it happens.
 *
 * The remaining weakness is inherent to measuring energy: RMS cannot tell speech
 * from any other sound at the same level, so a slammed door in a quiet room
 * still reaches Whisper. Telling them apart needs a model, and that is a trade
 * this page cannot make cheaply - it would mean a second ONNX Runtime session
 * where Transformers.js already chains every session onto one promise that a
 * single rejection poisons, competing for the same cores as Whisper decode on
 * exactly the device that has none to spare.

/**
 * The threshold is a multiple of the measured noise floor rather than the

 * absolute: gain varies by device, by OS input setting, and by how far away the
 * speaker is sitting. A fixed level fails in both directions and both failures
 * are total rather than gradual. Too low for the room and every frame reads as
 * speech, so segments only ever end at the cap and Whisper is handed 15 s of
 * noise - which it does not return empty for, it hallucinates ("Thank you.",
 * "Subtitles by ...") straight into the transcript, and from there into the
 * solve prompt. Too high and nothing ever crosses, which looks exactly like a
 * broken feature.
 *
 * Opening a segment takes more than keeping one open. The gap stops a keyboard
 * click or a chair scrape from starting a segment, while letting a sentence
 * that trails off stay in one.

 * the voice, the threshold follows it, and the VAD goes deaf in the middle of
 * the sentence it is listening to - silently, since a transcript that stops has
 * no way of saying why.
 *
 * Falling fast means a quiet room is measured almost immediately, and every

 * utterance lasts long enough to lift the floor to its own level.

 * which reads as fluent text that happens to be wrong. In an exam the first
 * word is disproportionately the one that matters, since it is often the
 * question word. This costs nothing at inference time, since Whisper pads every
