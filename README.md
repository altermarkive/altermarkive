# [Sovereign Compute](sovereign-compute)

## To Do

- Add [Kueue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue) controller to the local cluster
- If necessery to govern the queue with a git repo then consider [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj) (possibly consider [Weave GitOps](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave-gitops) community driven project, and [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2))
- Consider switching from `Ansible` to [`pyinfra-dev/pyinfra`](https://github.com/pyinfra-dev/pyinfra)
- Secure the Cluster
